## Introduction
How to use git command

## Getting Started
### The definitions
- remote repository: the target git URL
- remote (tracking) branch: \<remote repository\>/<branch>
```
ex) origin/master, origin/main
```

To update remote branch from remote repository, use 'git fetch' command.
```
$ git fetch <remote repository> <local branch>:<remote branch>
```
In this case, <remote branch> indicates without <remote repository>. This <remote branch> is called as 'upstream branch'.
- tracking branch: the local branch from remote branch

### 1. git clone <git URL>
At first, to download the git repository, you need to use `git clone` command

### 2. git branch -vv
Next, use `git branch` command to list the branches.
```
ex) $ git branch -vv
      iss53     7e424c3 [origin/iss53: ahead 2] forgot the brackets
      master    1ae2a45 [origin/master] deploying index fix
    * serverfix f8674d9 [teamone/server-fix-good: ahead 3, behind 1] this should do it
      testing   5ea463a trying something new
```
- iss53 local branch is tracking origin/iss53 (upstream branch) by 2 ahead which means that local branch has 2 more commits.
- master local branch is tracking origin/master as same.
- serverfix local branch is tracking teamone/server-fix-good by 3 ahead and 1 behind which means that local branch has 3 more commits that does not send to remote repository and 1 more commit remote repository does not merge with serverfix local branch.
- testing local branch is not tracking the remote branch.

### 3. git checkout <local branch>
Use `git checkout` command to make new local branch.  
To get the traching branch from remote branch, use `git checkout -b <local branch> <remote repository>/<remote branch>`.

### 4. git add <file1> <file2> <file3> ...
Use `git add` command before commit to git repository.  
If you want update all the files, you can use `git add .` easily.

### 5. git commit -m "~~~"
Use `git commit` command to commit the updates to git repository.  
If you don't want to write comment, you can use `git commit -a --allow-empty-message -m ""`.

### 6. git push <remote> <local branch>
Use `git push` command for sending local branch to remote repository with permission.

## Additional git commands
### Pull from remote branch
```
$ git fetch <remote repository> <local branch>:<remote branch>
$ git merge <remote repository>/<remote branch>
```

### Track the remote branch
```
$ git checkout --track <remote repository>/<remote branch>
```

### Track the remote branch from local branch
```
$ git branch --set-upstream-to origin/serverfix
$ git branch -u origin/serverfix
```
